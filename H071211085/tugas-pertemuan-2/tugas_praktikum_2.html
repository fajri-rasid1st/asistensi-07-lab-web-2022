        <h3> Best Heroes To Play On This Patch  </h3>
        <div class="content">
            <div class="content-item">
                <img src="image/antimage.png">
                <h4> Anti Mage </h4>
                <p> Should Anti-Mage have the opportunity to gather his full strength, few can stop his assaults. Draining mana from enemies with every strike or teleporting short distances to escape an ambush, cornering him is a challenge for any foe. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="content-item">
                <img src="image/pudge.png">
                <h4> Pudge </h4>
                <p> Each carefully aimed throw of Pudge's signature hook strikes fear into his foes. Pulling his enemies near to carve them with his cleavers, he gains additional health and damage with every kill, and soon becomes an unstoppable killer. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="content-item">
                <img src="image/lion.png">
                <h4> Lion </h4>
                <p> Lion gives enemies little chance to retaliate. Stunning targets with a damaging row of spikes, or temporarily transforming them into a harmless critter, even if his powerful spells aren't enough, he and his allies should still have all the time they need to slay their foes. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="content-item">
                <img src="image/juggernaut.png">
                <h4> Juggernaut </h4>
                <p> In a flurry of slashes, Juggernaut cuts down his foes. Sprinting and spinning into battle with reckless abandon, and nearly invincible once he is able to begin his assault, stopping Juggernaut can often be just as difficult as surviving him. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="content-item">
                <img src="image/nevermore.png">
                <h4> Shadow Fiend </h4>
                <p> Capturing souls from every kill he makes, Shadow Fiend is always gathering his power. Every assault, each carefully aimed raze that kills an enemy, brings him closer to unleashing his gathered souls in a deadly blast of scouring energy. </p>

                <h4> Witch Doctor </h4>
                <p> Witch Doctor is whatever his team needs him to be. Whether aiding his team with gradual healing, stunning and cursing foes to ensure a kill, or destroying enemies himself with a dance by his mighty ultimate, few can match Witch Doctor's versatility. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="content-item">
                <img src="image/invoker.png">
                <h4> Invoker </h4>
                <p> With an intricate arsenal of spells at his disposal, Invoker can adapt to any battle situation. Each configuration of his three spell components yields of one of ten spells, meaning he's never without a way to destroy or escape his enemies. </p>

                <img src="image/phantom_assassin.png">
                <h4> Phantom Assasin </h4>
                <p> The moment she finds her prey, Phantom Assassin strikes. Instantly closing in on a target, she effortlessly dodges attacks as she relentlessly cuts away at her foe. Without warning, any one of her attacks could prove suddenly and brutally fatal. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="content-item">
                <img src="image/crystal_maiden.png">
                <h4> Crystal Maiden </h4>
                <p> Able to keep her allies supplied with mana as she slows down enemies to ensure a kill, Crystal Maiden is a helpful addition to any team. And, when the opportunity arises, she can unleash her massive ultimate ability to devastate her foes. </p>

                <img src="image/axe.png">
                <h4> Axe </h4>
                <p> One after another, Axe cuts down his foes. Marching ahead of his team, he locks his enemies in battle then counters their blows with a deadly spin of his weapon. Slamming his culling blade through a weakened enemy, he is always charging onward.. </p>
