This is a page created with laravel 8 and bootstrap 4.

## Description

The propose of this page is make a model for a shop website with authentification for users and clients. The authentification has been created with laravel ui, I know, the experts recommend use jetstream, but I thought that it would be interesting see if we can use laravel ui without problem in laravel 8, and in effect it has been possible.

If the person logged is an user, this person has access to add, update or delete product. But if is a client, he only can add items to the cart and do a checkout.

In the product section there is a preview model that change when press the preview button. And when the user considers that the product is ok, he can add to the database an is showing in the list of the product, where he can delete or edit any product.
